Offer Holder Day Salford

Here you will find all the content you need to get a taste of Creative Computing at Salford!

Here’s what to do:
1)	Download the zip file called p5demo on Github to the Downloads folder on your computer
2)	Unzip (extract) the zip file to the Downloads folder (this location is important!)
3)	In Downloads, you’ll now have a p5demo folder that contains:
a.	the Instructions (in a Word and a PDF version)
b.	 a folder called ex1-symmetry–contains the codes for the first example (it also contains notes/instructions). To open this in p5.js, first open the program Visual Studio Code, then hit Ctrl+O and open the folder directly through the program. 
c.	 folder called ex2-image-layers---contains code and data for the second example (it also contains notes/instructions). To open this in p5.js, first open the program Visual Studio Code, then hit Ctrl+O and open the folder directly through the program.

Important! Make sure you work from the p5demo folder in Downloads, and not from inside the zip file.
