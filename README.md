<h2>A taste of creative coding</h2>

Here’s what to do:
1)	Download the zip file called <strong>p5demo</strong> on Github to the Downloads folder on your computer
2)	Unzip (extract) the zip file to the Downloads folder (this location is important!)
3)	In Downloads, you’ll now have a <strong>p5demo</strong> folder that contains:
a.	the Instructions (in a Word and a PDF version)
b.	 a folder called <strong>ex1-symmetry</strong>–contains the codes for the first example (it also contains notes/instructions). To open this in p5.js, first open the program Visual Studio Code, then hit Ctrl+O and open the folder directly through the program. 
c.	 folder called <strong>ex2-image-layers</strong>---contains code and data for the second example (it also contains notes/instructions). To open this in p5.js, first open the program Visual Studio Code, then hit Ctrl+O and open the folder directly through the program.

Important! Make sure you work from the <strong>p5demo</strong> folder in Downloads, and <strong>not from inside the zip file</strong>!
